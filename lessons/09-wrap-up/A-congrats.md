Congratulations!! You did it!

This is a lot of material to take in, so congrats on sticking with it. Hopefully it was fun and maybe made you support your local pizzeria along the way!

You are now fully equipped to write React professionally. Everything you learned here is 95%+ of what you would need to write React at any tech company. The last 5% is what I'll teach you in [Intermediate React v6][v6] which has more to do with server-side React and advance performance techniques. But for now, this is almost all you need to know!

So what should you do from here?

- [Intermediate React v5][v5] is still very relevant! Take this course and learn more about Tailwind, server-side rendering, more hooks, Redux, and a bunch of there cool things. I'll update this when the new Intermediate React v6 comes out.
- Follow the rest of the [Frontend Masters React Learning Path][path].
- Build your own app!! I cannot stress how important it is with concepts like this to just build. Take the dumbest idea in your head and make it. Nothing can replace experience!
  - An e-commerce website to sell single socks so you can match unmatched socks
  - An AI prompt text editor
  - A music app that lets you add Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal songs to it.
  - A client to let you read Thread, X, and Bluesky in the same app.
- Learn [Next.js][next], Remix/React-Router (soon those will be the same thing) or some other way of doing React on the server
- Learn React + [Tailwind][tailwind]

There are lots of way to go with this and they're all fun! I hope you enjoyed the course and I look forward to hopefully getting to teach with you again soon!
